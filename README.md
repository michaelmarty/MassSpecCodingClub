# Mass Spec Coding Club
The Mass Spec Coding Club (MSCC) is a community dedicated to education of computer coding applied to mass spectrometry applications. Our goal is to make coding accessible to mass spectrometry researchers and provide free resources and open-source examples. 

As the community develops, we will continue to post more content, and we welcome contributions from anyone. 

# Discord Server

Want to chat with community members and join meetings, join us on the [Mass Spec Coding Club Discord Server](https://discord.gg/24GupxGn3d). It's easy to set up, and you can run it from a browser if you'd like. We will pick a time soon and start hosting meetings/office hours there. 

In the meantime, feel free to post questions to the text channels there, and people can answer. 

# Learning Modules

## Module 0: Setting Up Python and Plotting A Spectrum

This series of lessons will cover how to set up Python from scratch and write a simple script to plot a mass spectrum. Skills and learning outcomes are outlined below each video

  * How to set up and run Python
  * Setting variables
  * Printing to the terminal
* [Lesson 0.1: Loading Data Into Python](https://youtu.be/vpbdUQp8m0U)
  * Importing libraries
  * Reading from text files into NumPy arrays
  * Intro to array slicing
* [Lesson 0.2: Plotting a Spectrum](https://youtu.be/88m4a9CEeBY)
  * Plotting a spectrum with MatPlotLib
  * Normalizing the y-axis
* [Lesson 0.3: Too Fast, Go Back - Review and Background from Module 0](https://youtu.be/V6alRhace2A)
  * Fundamentals of how computers work

  * String manipulation
  * Passing variables through functions
  * If/then statements
  * Monoisotopic mass calculation for protein
* [Lesson 1.2: Calculating Masses from Glycans, SMILES, and Formulas](https://youtu.be/XSgA7SODmSg)
  * Using Glypy to calculate masses from GlycoCT strings
  * Using molmass to calculate masses from formulas
  * Using RDKit to calculate masses from SMILES strings
* [Lesson 1.3: Too Fast, Go Back - For Loops, If/Then, and Function Options](https://youtu.be/xg1QxAzznkg)
  * Writing For loops
  * If/Then statements and Boolean tests
  * Passing options to functions
* Homework 1

# Ideas for Future Tutorials

Here are some ideas that users have suggested. If you have other suggestions, please enter them in the ["What Projects Would You Like to See?"](https://github.com/michaelmarty/MassSpecCodingClub/discussions/3) discussion. If you would like to volunteer to make a module on one of these topics, please add your name here.

* Plotting multiple spectra with for loops and string parsing (Michael Marty)
* Reading vendor files
* Writing to different output files
* Exploring other Python MS packages
* How to use public databases (Ming?)
* Applications to polymers and oligonucleotides
* Ion mobility
* Using Git and GitHub
* Gasp, R!
  * There are a lot of great R resources for MS already, so maybe we could organize and link those here too.
