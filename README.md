# Mass Spec Coding Club
The Mass Spec Coding Club (MSCC) is a community dedicated to education of computer coding applied to mass spectrometry applications. Our goal is to make coding accessible to mass spectrometry researchers and provide free resources and open-source examples. 

As the community develops, we will continue to post more content, and we welcome contributions from anyone.
