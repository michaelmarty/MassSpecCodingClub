# Lesson 0 Notes

## The 3 key parts of the computer:

* Hard Drive: Permanent file storage
* Memory: Temporary storage of information
* Processor: Carries out operations on data

## Basic Processor Operations

* Input: Read data from memory or hard drive
* Process: Arithmetic or logic operations
* Output: Display or output data in other forms
* Store: Write data to memory or hard drive

## Computer code

A (typically linear) set of operations for the computer to perform.

## Types of objects in Python

* Variables: Data stored in memory
  * float: 3.0
  * int: 3
  * string: "Hello World"
  * bool: True
  * list/array: [0, 1, 2]
  * dict: {"Name": "Python Champion"}
* Functions: Perform a series of operations based on inputs and return outputs
  * add(a, b)
  * plot(x, y)
* Classes: Collections of variables and/or functions grouped together
  * Library/Package: Importable collection of variables, functions, and classes
